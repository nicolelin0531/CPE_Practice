Problems in Computer Science are often classified as belonging to a certain class of problems (e.g.,
NP, Unsolvable, Recursive). In this problem you will be analyzing a property of an algorithm whose
classification is not known for all possible inputs.
Consider the following algorithm:
1. input n
2. print n
3. if n = 1 then STOP
4. if n is odd then n  􀀀 3n + 1
5. else n  􀀀 n/2
6. GOTO 2
Given the input 22, the following sequence of numbers will be printed
22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
It is conjectured that the algorithm above will terminate (when a 1 is printed) for any integral input
value. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, it is unknown whether this conjecture is true. It has
been verified, however, for all integers n such that 0 < n < 1; 000; 000 (and, in fact, for many more
numbers than this.)
Given an input n, it is possible to determine the number of numbers printed before and including
the 1 is printed. For a given n this is called the cycle-length of n. In the example above, the cycle
length of 22 is 16.
For any two numbers i and j you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers
between and including both i and j.

Sample Input
1 10
100 200
201 210
900 1000
Sample Output
1 10 20
100 200 125
201 210 89
900 1000 174
